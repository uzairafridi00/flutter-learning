## Flutter Development

	flutter create flutter_guide

	flutter packages get          => to ensure all the packages installed


## Folder Structure:

	Delete web folder as you are not building a Website and keep other files as it is.
	
	android folder => it contains all the Android based Java files which you can change
	build folder => this holds the output of your app and manage by flutter sdk
	ios folder => it contains all the IOS based files which you can change
	
	lib folder => stands for library and most imp because it is the folder where we do 99% of our work
			All the dart and flutter code lies here

	test folder => write automated tests for your application

	pubspec.yaml => this is a file that allows to mostly manage dependencies of your project.
			here we can configure which the third party packages our app might be using.
