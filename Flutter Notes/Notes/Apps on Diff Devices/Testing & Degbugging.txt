		Running the APP on an IOS Emulator

	You need MAC OS to run the emulator and test the app.
	For that you need XCode

	Open XCode -> Open Another Project -> navigate to project -> ios folder -> Runner.xcodeproj -> Open this file

	You should have team -> otherwise create account -> give apple credentials
	
	For developing IOS apps -> you need to have developer account


developer.apple.com


	Login with your ID -> For developing and testing you don't need to pay for account
	
	For uploading the app to IOS store you need to pay for it.

	Now Choose your team after making developer account.

	In VS Code -> open -a Simulator.app
