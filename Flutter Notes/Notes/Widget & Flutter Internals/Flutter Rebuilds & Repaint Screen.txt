				Behind the scenes

Flutter does not redraw/recreate the entire UI on every build(){...} method call. 
We will discuss this in detail further.

Flutter aims to give you a 60 FPS (Frames Per Second) application. 
So, it updates the screen 60 times per second. 
It means that the screen is repainted by Flutter 60 times per second. 
This however is not bad because all apps and games run at 60 FPS or more by default.

This would only become inefficient if Flutter would have to recalculate the entire layout 60 times per second!

If Flutter draws something onto the screen for the first time it needs 
to figure out the position, color, text, etc. of every element on the screen.
In short, during the first render, only the flutter needs to configure every single pixel on the screen.


For subsequent repaints/draws, i.e, for refreshes of the UI if nothing changed 
then Flutter takes the old information that it has already derived previously and 
paints that on the screen which is super duper fast and very efficient.

Hence, the refresh rate is not the problem, it would only be a problem 
if Flutter had to calculate everything on the screen with every refresh.
This is what we will discuss in detail here that if Flutter recalculates 
everything whenever a build(){...} method is called.
