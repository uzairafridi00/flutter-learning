			Const Widget and Constructors

Every stateless widget is Const because no value changes
and they are immutable.


	// Why would have const with Widget?
	// You can escape unnecessary widget rebuilds if you mark a widget 
	// const in Widget Tree


	// This will increase the performance of your app

	// We add the 'const' keyword with those widgets which don't change
	// during runtime.

	// You can't assign the 'const' to dynamic widget

	


The object is immutable but new objects (with different data/config) are 
created between rebuilds.
