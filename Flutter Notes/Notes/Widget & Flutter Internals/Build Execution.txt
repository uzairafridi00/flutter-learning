		How Flutter executes build(){...} method


	The build(){...} method is called by Flutter whenever the state changes. 
	There are basically two important triggers that can lead to a rebuild.

1) One is when the setState(){...} method is called in a stateful widget.  
   Calling setState(){...} automatically leads to build(){...} method call.


2) Secondly, whenever there is a MediaQuery call or Theme.of(...)... call, 
   the soft keyboard appears/disappears, etc. whenever the data of these changes 
   it automatically triggers the build(){...} method.
