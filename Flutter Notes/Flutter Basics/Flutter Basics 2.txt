		Passing Callback Functions Around


	Everything in Flutter is an object. 

	Lifting the State up.

	We can also pass the pointer to function of Widget.
	
	You can pass the function to your Widget.

	The function (address) we are passing around is also known as a "Callback" -
	because the receiving widget calls it the future.

	// And in the Widget you then accept the pointer that is passed.

	

final Function selectHandler;

Answer({this.selectHandler});



	// If you get an error with the "selectHandler" property, you can change 

final Function selectHandler; 

	to

final VoidCallback selectHandler;

		
	// When Passing the CallBackFunction

Answer(selectHandler:() => answerQuestion()),

		INTRODUCING MAPS


	{} or Map() => Collection of key value pairs 

	{'Key': 'value'} or {1: 'value'} or {1: 12}

	The key and value can be of any type

	

{'questionText': 'What your name?', 'answers': ['black', 'Max', 'Mike']}


var questions = [
	{
	  'questionText': 'What your name?', 
	  'answers': ['black', 'Max', 'Mike']
	}
]





****************** MAPPING LISTS TO WIDGETS ******************

	Accessing the Map Questios

questionText: questions[_questionIndex]['questionText'] as String,



	Instead of hard coding the Widgets you can dynamically define questions
	

questions[_questionIndex]['answers'].map((question) {
	return Answer(answer)
})
	


	By default Dart doesn't recognize the Lists contained inside map of answers
	So we explicitly tell to Dart that it is a List of String or int.



(questions[_questionIndex]['answers'] as List<Strinf>).map((question) {
	return Answer(answer)
})

		... => Spread Operator  => 030 -> Watch Again
	
	In Dart, Spread Operator (…) and Null-aware Spread Operator (…?) 
	are used for inserting multiple elements in a collection like Lists, Maps, etc.


...(questions[_questionIndex]['answers'] as List<String>).map((answer) {
              return Answer(selectHandler: answerQuestion, answerText: answer);
}).toList()

			Final vs Const

	final => use final if a value doesn't change from the point of time when the program runs.
		it can be initialized with the value.

	

	const a = const 'a'
	 
 	We can write const infront of variable and also infront of value.
	If we write it infront of variable then the variable will be constant and if with the value then the
	value will be constant.

	

	Dart store everything as an object in memory.
	Variables are just the pointer to objects
	
	We store an object in variable => technically we store an address of object in variable.

	

var dummy = const ['Hello'];
dummy.add('Hi');
print(dummy);


	It will throw error because we initialized the value as Const 
	and after updating the dummy the whole list created again 
	
	So only make value const in those cases when you know that I will not change it in future.
