	Widget State

___________________________________________


StatelessWidget and StatefullWidget


State => is a generic class by flutter

	
	We do make two classes for this to change the state by User Input
	because we want to persistant our previous states data
	so that it can build statefulWidget


	It will build connection between StatefulWidget and State Widget


class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {

	@override
	State<StatefulWidget> createState() {
		return MyAppState();
	}
}

class MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
	
	//All your Code of your Widget


	
	setState(() {
	
		// That part of code which will change the UI
		// A function that force flutter to re-render the interface
		// It calls build again but not re-render all the UI
		// It just change or update that part which we changed
	})
}

	PRIVATE PROPERTIES

	_ => converts the public class to Private class so it will not use outside of file

	Same with Variables add Underscore infront of it.

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp>
